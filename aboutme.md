My name is Jeff Handley. I've been creating web applications for over 20 years. I grew up on the Microsoft stack but now I focus on Node, React, Redux, and GraphQL. I have passion for implementing large web applications that provide end-user productivity and delight.

The teams I've worked with have a proven ability to deliver short-term developer productivity and long-term maintainability for web applications ranging from 10 screens to over 1000.

I've been recognized for having an unparalleled sense of ownership in products and user experiences, which has resulted in leading many teams through successful releases.
