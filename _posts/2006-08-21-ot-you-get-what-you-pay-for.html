<p>Yet another off-topic post... Kelly and I&nbsp;found that&nbsp;the cord on our&nbsp;iron&nbsp;was getting very hot (it has a short I'm sure).&nbsp; Since I'm not all that handy, we went to buy a new iron rather than trying to fix the cord on the old one.</p> <p>We went to good old Walmart, and after looking at the irons for a few minutes, we opted to just get the cheap one ($7).&nbsp; We didn't think we needed one of the digital irons ($30-$40)&nbsp;with all the bells and whistles (they literally&nbsp;make sounds).&nbsp; Just a plain old iron we thought, so we grabbed the DuraBrand iron.</p> <p>Using the new iron for a week resulted in some frustrations.&nbsp; It was taking me 20-25 minutes each morning to iron an outfit, which is just not acceptable.&nbsp; Staring at a pile of clean laundry that all needed to be ironed, Kelly suggested that we go get a <strong>real</strong> iron, and I thought that was a great idea.</p> <p>So, after finding that the $40 Sunbeam that we picked out wasn't in stock, we went to our next choice, which was a <a href="http://www.gehousewares.com/action/browseproduct?content_id=249" target="_blank">$37 GE model.</a>&nbsp; After using it to iron a few loads of laundry, I was reminded once again that you get what you pay for.&nbsp; Amazing the difference from a $7 iron to a $37 iron.</p> <p>Some (un)lucky person will become the new owner of a virtually brand new DuraBrand iron after we give it to charity.</p>
