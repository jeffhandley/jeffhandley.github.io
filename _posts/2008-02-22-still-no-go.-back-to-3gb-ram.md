<p>After <a href="http://blog.jeffhandley.com/archive/2008/02/19/video-card-update---vista-service-pack-1.aspx" target="_blank">installing Vista Service Pack 1</a> things seemed to be running pretty well.  Both ATI cards were functioning and looking good.  But after a couple hours of use, system performance degraded, especially relating to video.  Then the ATI drivers crashed and restarted successfully, just like the <a href="http://blog.jeffhandley.com/archive/2008/02/04/video-card-woes---up-to-3-screens-down-to.aspx" target="_blank">nVidia drivers did</a>.</p>  <p>So, back to 3GB RAM.  I will submit a ticket to Microsoft when I have the energy.  Otherwise, I am considering this case closed.  I cannot use 4GB RAM and 2 video cards on this Dell OptiPlex with Vista 64-bit.</p>
