I'm reading the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/10/01/news/pdf/index.htm">new bill </a>right now, and by page 11, I've understood it to say the following:<br /><ul><li>If a bank gives a loan to someone for a house that they cannot afford, they need not worry</li><li>The government will buy the "asset" from them for whatever was paid</li><li>If the bank sells out or files bankruptcy, the government might pay MORE than what the bank paid</li></ul><p>I think I'll open a new bank, give lots of homeless people loans to buy mobile homes for a million bucks.  I'll draw a $120million salary until I file bankruptcy and stick the government with the bill.</p>
