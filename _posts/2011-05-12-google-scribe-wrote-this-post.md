<p>I saw mention of <a target="_blank" href="http://scribe.googlelabs.com/">Google Scribe</a> the other day.  If you open it up in Chrome, it has a feature for reading your mind.  Okay, it’s just word completion.  While I can usually type a word out faster than I can read what auto-completion is providing me, break my stride, hit the space bar, and pick back up on the next word… it’s still fun.  For extra funness, I decided to see what Scribe would produce if I typed only 1 letter and then let auto-complete run with it until it stops suggesting words.  I did this for each letter of the alphabet, both upper- and lower-case as the results were different.</p>
<p>Below is what Google Scribe produced for me.  On each line, I merely typed the first letter and then let auto-completion do the rest.  When it stopped suggesting words, I hit enter and went to the next letter.</p>
