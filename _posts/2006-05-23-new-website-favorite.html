Anyone who knows me probably knows that I'm a grammar freak.  I'm not saying my grammar is perfect; it's nowhere close.  But I have many pet peeves regarding common mistakes with the English language.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ThanksNo.aspx" target="Scott">Scott Hanselman blogged</a> about some one-page reference sites, including a link to <a href="http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/errors.html" target="Errors">this link</a> to a site listing common errors made with the English language.  Although it's not the prettiest of sites, I like it a lot and I marked it as a favorite.<br /><br />Probably one of my biggest pet peeves is this one: <a href="http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/care.html" target="Errors">"Could care less" vs. "Could not care less"</a>.  If you could care less, that means that you care, but the point you're trying to make is that you don't care at all and therefore, you could not care less.
