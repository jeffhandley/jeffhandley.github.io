<p>I got a new workstation at the office yesterday.  Shiny new Dell Optiplex 740 with an AMD x64 processor.  I decided to make the leap and install Windows Vista Business 64-bit.</p>  <p>So I assembled the computer this morning and fired off the installation.  I'm not off to a great start though... when Vista got to the "Completing installation" step, I got a blue screen of death and the installation cannot continue.  Starting over.</p>
