<p>So, Mark, one of the managers at the insurance company, called me this morning around 10am.&nbsp; He was very polite and listened to my description of the problem and all of the background information.</p> <p>He quickly dismissed the insurance company's liability for any problems I'm having though.&nbsp; I mentioned to him the blurb I found on the estimate regarding their "Promise".&nbsp; He was surprised to hear about that as he's not familiar with having that sort of text on an estimate.&nbsp; I told him I could fax it to him, which I just did.</p> <p>It sounds like he's going to lean on the body shop to have them own up to having installed the quarter-panel incorrectly.&nbsp; But he said if there was something that should've been replaced or done&nbsp;that wasn't included on the estimate, he would certainly own up to that and cover the repairs.</p> <p>I'm guessing all of this will go nowhere.&nbsp; The insurance company will say it was improper installation that caused my problems, for which they are not liable.&nbsp; And the body shop will say they are not liable for rust problems, even though the rust is a direct result of poor installation.&nbsp; But it can't hurt to try to get someone else to pay for the work, so we'll see where this leads.</p>
