<span style="font-family:arial;">Well, it took me a few days... but I finally have all of the sample code and everything packaged up from my presentation this past week. <a href="http://jeffhandley.com/Presentations/CINNUG-2005-05-17.zip">You can find the zip file here.</a><br /><br />In the zip file you will find the following:<br /><br /></span> <ul  style="font-family:arial;">   <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">ASP.NET_1.x.zip</span><br />Sample Application Framework in ASP.NET 1.x (VB)</li>   <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">ASP.NET_2.0.zip</span><br />Sample Application Framework in ASP.NET 2.0 (C#)</li>   <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">CINNUG_Survey.sql<br /></span>SQL script to create the database used by the Sample Application Framework</li>   <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Custom Web Controls Everywhere.ppt<br /></span>PowerPoint presentation used</li>   <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Demo.zip<br /></span>The project used for the 2 demos during the presentation (noted in the PowerPoint)</li> </ul><span style="font-family:arial;">I would appreciate it if you could complete the quick evaluation of the presentation I gave. This survey application uses the sample asp.net framework that is included in this zip file.  <a href="http://www.jeffhandley.com/Survey.aspx" target="Survey">The evaluation can be found here</a>.<br /><br />Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have questions or problems with the zip file, or if you'd like to discuss some of the topics included in the presentation.<br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">Thanks to James Avery and the Cincinnati .NET User Group.  I had a great time and I look forward to speaking again.</span>
