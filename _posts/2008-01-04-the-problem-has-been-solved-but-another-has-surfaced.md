<p>2/29/2036 is a Friday; 1 have occurred in 28 years   <br />2/29/2064 is a Friday; 2 have occurred in 56 years    <br />This is also a payday; 1 have occurred in 56 years    <br />    <br />2/29/2092 is a Friday; 3 have occurred in 84 years    <br />2/29/2104 is a Friday; 4 have occurred in 96 years    <br />2/29/2132 is a Friday; 5 have occurred in 124 years    <br />This is also a payday; 2 have occurred in 124 years    <br />    <br />2/29/2160 is a Friday; 6 have occurred in 152 years    <br />2/29/2188 is a Friday; 7 have occurred in 180 years    <br />This is also a payday; 3 have occurred in 180 years    <br />    <br />2/29/2228 is a Friday; 8 have occurred in 220 years    <br />2/29/2256 is a Friday; 9 have occurred in 248 years    <br />This is also a payday; 4 have occurred in 248 years    <br />    <br />2/29/2284 is a Friday; 10 have occurred in 276 years    <br />2/29/2324 is a Friday; 11 have occurred in 316 years    <br />This is also a payday; 5 have occurred in 316 years</p>  <p>I didn't expect every 7th leap year to put the 29th on a Friday, but it's pretty close to that pattern.Â  Next, I want to see the pattern of what day of the week the 29th falls on.</p>
