This is a photo finish folks!  Obama was elected Tuesday night.  Friday, he held his first press conference and he managed to piss off 2 people pretty badly.<div><p _extended="true">When a reporter asked Obama if he had spoken with any  ex-presidents since his election on Tuesday, he responded that he had spoken to  all former presidents "that are living."</p> <p _extended="true">"I didn't want to get into a Nancy Reagan thing about, you  know, doing any seances," he said.</p><p _extended="true">Also during the conference, Obama reiterated that he believes a nuclear-armed Iran would be "unacceptable."  He also said he would help mount an international effort to prevent it from  happening.</p><p _extended="true">Obama had to call Nancy Reagan and apologize to her.  And Iran's President <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Ahmadinejad's</span> office has issued a statement saying that Obama should apply his campaign message of change to U.S. dealings with  Iran.</p><p _extended="true">I'm not surprised that he made a careless remark to piss off a republican president's wife.  However, I didn't expect Obama to piss <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Ahmadinejad</span> off the very week he was elected, let alone before he even takes office.</p><p _extended="true">So who was the first one to be pissed off at Obama? During his press conference, he discussed Iran about half-way through the conference.  He didn't make the remark about Mrs. Reagan until several minutes later.  So the winner is: President <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Ahmadinejad</span>!!</p><p _extended="true">Again, I didn't see that coming.</p><p _extended="true"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Sources:<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal; "><a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/politics/2008/11/07/obama.briefing.entire.cnn"></a></span></span></p><p _extended="true"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal; "><a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/politics/2008/11/07/obama.briefing.entire.cnn">http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/politics/2008/11/07/obama.briefing.entire.cnn</a><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic; "><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/07/obama.seance/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/07/obama.seance/index.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/11/08/iran.obama/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/11/08/iran.obama/index.html</a></span></span></span></p></div>
