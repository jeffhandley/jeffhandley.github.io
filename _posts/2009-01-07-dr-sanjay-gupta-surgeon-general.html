<p>I’ve always been very impressed with Dr. Gupta.&#160; We watch quite a bit of CNN and he never ceases to amaze me with his breadth and depth of knowledge.&#160; As it turns out, Obama’s administration is impressed with him too.&#160; Read <a title="CNN talks about Dr. Gupta as the possible surgeon general" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/06/gupta.surgeon.general/index.html" target="_blank">this article</a> and you’ll be blown away at everything this guy does.&#160; How on Earth does he have time for all of that!?</p>
