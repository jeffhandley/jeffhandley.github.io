<p>I was talking with someone last night about how <em>simple</em> websites are the ones that catch on.  Google.com is the best example--their homepage has always been unbelievably simple, and that has been key to them becoming the <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/62254" target="_blank">search leader</a>.  I was trying to remember the site that I saw awhile back that was another example of <em>simple</em>, for creating a web pages.</p>  <p>I could remember that the site used a markup language different from wiki formats, and the language was targeted toward writers, focusing on simplicity.  But for the life in me, I couldn't remember what the site was, or what the markup language was.  I knew that I read about the site on one of the blogs I read, but I just couldn't remember any details.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> to the rescue!  It did take me 5 minutes, which is about the longest it's ever taken me to find anything with Google or <a href="http://desktop.google.com" target="_blank">Google Desktop</a>, but here's how I found it:</p>  <p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="182" alt="image" src="http://blog.jeffhandley.com/Images/PostImages/KeepingitSimpleandSearchingmyBrainwithGo_7896/image_thumb.png" width="588" border="0" /> </p>  <p>After the "markup language" search failed to produce anything useful, I remembered that the markup language that I was searching for made it easy to underline things and make different heading levels.  Also, it's targeted toward writers as I mentioned.  The search for "markup writer underline heading" let me find <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a> and when I saw the name, it immediately clicked.</p>  <p>Next was to find the website that let you use Markdown to get a simple start to making a website.  Searching for "markdown simple start" brought back <a href="http://www.google.com/history/url?url=http://www.hanselman.com/blog/LaunchingYourWeb20SiteWithAGiantTextBox.aspx&amp;ei=LL9OR_b_EaW-kwGZvJFL&amp;sig2=FUMv_-bxzc5P1i-r1clTUQ&amp;zx=4th3Ae2D2ko&amp;ct=w" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman's post</a> that I read long ago and there it was, <a href="http://jottit.com/" target="_blank">jottit</a> -- Bingo!</p>  <p>The way the brain makes connections to allow us to remember things is amazing.  And Google is a close second for me.</p>
