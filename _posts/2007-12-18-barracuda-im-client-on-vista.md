<p>I have to use <a href="http://www.barracudanetworks.com/ns/products/im_overview.php" target="_blank">Barracuda IM</a> for one of my clients<em>*</em>.  I typically only sign in when we're shipping a new release though.  Today is one of those days, and I tried to install the client on my Vista machine, but I'm not having any luck.</p>  <p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="173" alt="Another Barracuda IM client is currently running.  You must quit the running program to continue with the Barracuda IM client installation." src="/img/postimages/BarracudaIMClientonVista_DF09/image.png" width="493" border="0" /></p>  <p>Needless to say, this machine has never seen Barracuda before, so the installer must be making some sort of a mistake.  My client is going to check to see if there's a 64-bit install.</p>  <p><em>* This is by NO means an endorsement of Barracuda IM.  I'm not a fan myself, but my client requires it.</em></p>
