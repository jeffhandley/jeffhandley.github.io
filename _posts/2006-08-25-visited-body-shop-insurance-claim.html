<p>A couple of days ago, I spoke with Mark from the insurance company.&nbsp; He was going to get in contact with the body shop as if anyone was liable for my problems, it would be the body shop he said.</p> <p>He followed up and said that Mike from the body shop wanted me to bring the car out for him to look at.&nbsp; I contacted the shop yesterday and I was able to get the car out there yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; Mike was very cordial and he seemed sincerely concerned about my problems.&nbsp; He spent about 15-20 minutes looking at the car, and while he was doing so, I gave him all of the background.&nbsp; We briefly talked about the subsequent incident I had that damaged my rear bumper, but I assured him that the gentleman from the dealer that looked at the problems was convinced that the rust problems were unrelated to the bumper damage.</p> <p>I have rust in 3 places on the car:</p> <ol> <li>Along the edge of the trunk lid, and inside the trunk.&nbsp; I noticed yesterday that this extends under the rear window and it's pretty bad inside the trunk -- must worse than I had first thought.</li> <li>Where the quarter-panel meets the wheel well and the rear bumper (this is also pretty bad)</li> <li>Under the driver door, in the door jamb (just a small bubble)</li></ol> <p>I told Mike that I wasn't trying to pull one over on him and if he thought the rust was a direct result of the incident that damaged the bumper, I'd like him to tell me so.&nbsp; He said that he does believe the rust at the wheel well is a result of that damage, but he does not think the other problems are related -- they are from the original wreck and repairs.&nbsp; I was glad to hear him say this and I thought that assessment was perfectly reasonable.&nbsp; Right near the rust at the wheel well, the rear bumper is pulled away from the quarter-panel... So again, I think his assessment is reasonable.</p> <p>However, it's been over 6 years since the repairs were done.&nbsp; The body shop has since changed names (not sure of the details, but it became a franchise for a nation-wide company), they've moved locations, gotten all new management and staff, etc.&nbsp; They have no paperwork on site for my repairs.&nbsp; And I can't find my copy of the warranty or receipt for the work.&nbsp; But we all know the repairs were done there and paid for by the insurance company.</p> <p>Mike got a copy of the original estimate from the insurance company.&nbsp; And he asked if I had any pictures of the damage.&nbsp; I will&nbsp;upload the pictures in a subsequent post.&nbsp; He said that they typically only have a 5 year, 50,000 warranty on all aspects of their work, including workmanship, and I'm well beyond that.&nbsp; But he was going to contact corporate to see if paperwork could be located for my repairs and to discuss how to proceed.&nbsp; Something strange is that the company's web site claims that they have a lifetime guarantee on their workmanship and service.</p> <p>I still think this is going to lead nowhere and I'll be stuck fixing all of the problems myself, which will likely cost me a couple of thousand bucks -- but it has to be done.&nbsp; We'll see though, maybe I'll be shocked and surprised and the body shop will pick up the tab on the repairs.&nbsp; If they don't, I certainly won't be taking the car there for the repairs, or any other car for that matter.</p>
