<p>While dealing with customer support after a <a href="http://blog.jeffhandley.com/archive/2008/01/23/the-workaround-that-doesnt-work.aspx" target="_blank">recent release</a> that contained a few bugs, I've found myself having the following two thoughts very often.</p>  <ol>   <li>The word "work" is part of the word "workaround" for a reason.  As soon as I find a "fun-around" for any issue, I'll let you know.  In the meantime, please let me emphasize the "work" in this workaround.</li>    <li>If something seems to be perfectly logical, it's probably not what the user was expecting.</li> </ol>
