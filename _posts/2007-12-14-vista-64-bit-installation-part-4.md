<p>I joined the domain, which needed a reboot, and upon boot, I got the same blue screen error.Â  I took 2GB RAM back out, booted clean, ran Windows Update again, turned it off, added the memory back in, and booted just fine.</p>  <p>I think I'll try just rebooting a handful of times before I run any more installations.</p>
