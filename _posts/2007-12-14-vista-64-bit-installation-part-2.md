<p>I got the blue screen again.Â  This time I had enough time to see the error message: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL.</p>  <p>I found the following <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929777">knowledge base article</a>: Error message when you try to install Windows Vista on a computer that uses more than 3 GB of RAM.</p>  <p>This article states:</p>  <p><code>To apply this update, you must use the files that are included in this update package to update the Windows installation source files. For information about how to do this, see the OEM preinstall kit (OPK) documentation or the Automated Installation Kit (AIK) documentation.</code></p>  <p><font style="background-color: #fcfaf0">I am going to try taking out some RAM, installing, running Windows Update, and then adding the RAM back in.</font></p>  <p><font style="background-color: #fcfaf0">I installed Vista Ultimate (32-bit) on my machine at home with 4GB RAM -- no problems.</font></p>
