<p>Well, I <a href="http://blog.jeffhandley.com/archive/2007/12/21/video-card-woes.aspx" target="_blank">wrote VisionTek</a> on December 21, and I haven't heard back from them yet.</p>  <p>So, I just sent the same message to ATI directly.  We'll see if they have the courtesy to respond.</p>  <p>The box for the card touts the ability to run 2 of the cards and control up to 4 monitors.  I am thinking that in order to do that effectively, I'll need to be running off the DVI ports only and not one of the VGA ports.  This would require a DVI-I to dual VGA splitter Y cable.  I hunted around a bit and was having a hard time finding those online though.</p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:b43c43b3-042a-4a90-a861-9cb1d1195540" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/ATI" rel="tag">ATI</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Radeon" rel="tag">Radeon</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Vista" rel="tag">Vista</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/64-bit" rel="tag">64-bit</a></div>
