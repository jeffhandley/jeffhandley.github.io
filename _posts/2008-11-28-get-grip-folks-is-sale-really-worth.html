<p>This is sad.&#160; This is tragic.&#160; This is pathetic.</p>  <p>A Wal-Mart worker <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6529135" target="_blank">was killed</a> in a stampede today.&#160; And the shoppers didn’t seem to care.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I've been on [sic] line since yesterday morning.</p>    <p>&#160;</p> </blockquote>  <p><font color="#666666">They kept shopping after being told someone had been killed.&#160; This wasn’t some frail old lady either.&#160; This was a 34-year-old man.&#160; Is saving a few bucks really worth this?&#160; Get a grip folks.&#160; I know the economy is bad, but this is unreal—you don’t need to kill someone to save a few dollars on Christmas gifts.</font></p>
