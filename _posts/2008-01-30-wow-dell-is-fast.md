<p>My mother-in-law and a friend both wanted new machines for home.  I started monitoring <a href="http://gotapex.com" target="_blank">GotApex.com</a> for deals and I found one that I liked this past Saturday.  I placed the order a little after 9pm Saturday night, and the order was immediately acknowledged at "26 Jan 2008 21:18:32 -0600".</p>  <p>Everything arrived today, around 1pm.  That means they had them in my hands less than 88 hours after I ordered them.  And I just went with free, standard shipping.  Pretty amazing.</p>
