<p>My mother-in-law and a friend both wanted new machines for home.  I started monitoring <a href="http://gotapex.com" target="_blank">GotApex.com</a> for deals and I found one that I liked this past Saturday.  I placed the order a little after 9pm Saturday night, and the order was immediately acknowledged at "26 Jan 2008 21:18:32 -0600".</p>  <p>Everything arrived today, around 1pm.  That means they had them in my hands less than 88 hours after I ordered them.  And I just went with free, standard shipping.  Pretty amazing.</p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:dd4b5166-7d77-4ed4-b495-e572de411647" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Dell" rel="tag">Dell</a></div>
