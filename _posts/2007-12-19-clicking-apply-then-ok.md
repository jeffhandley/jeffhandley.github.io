<p>Something I've noticed that a lot of people do in Windows is click Apply and then OK.  While trying to find a solution to my <a href="http://blog.jeffhandley.com/archive/2007/12/18/kensington-expert-mouse-on-vista.aspx" target="_blank">Kensington mouse problem</a>, I saw some posted instructions that explicitly said to click Apply and then OK.</p>  <p>What surprises me most is how many developers I've seen do this.  When there are 3 buttons, OK, Cancel and Apply, everyone knows that clicking OK will also Apply the changes, right?  Save yourself 2 seconds and just click OK.</p>
