<p>Phil announced the release of Subtext 2.0 the other day, and I've been chomping at the bit to get it installed.  I have made a few tweaks to my install, so I knew it would require a little bit of attention.  All in all, the upgrade was very easy, but I used a couple of little tricks to make sure it was a clean upgrade.</p>
