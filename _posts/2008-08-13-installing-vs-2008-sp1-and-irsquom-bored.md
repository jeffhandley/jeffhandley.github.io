<p>Before leaving last night, I uninstalled all of the appropriate bits, and then fired off the installation for VS 2008 SP1.  I had heard it took a couple of hours, so I wanted to let it do its work while I was gone.</p>
<p>This morning, I arrived to find that the installation had paused, waiting for me to close down Word, Outlook and Internet Explorer.  So now I’ve closed those apps down and resumed the installation.</p>
<p>So, when I cannot use Office or IE, what should I be doing?  I don’t have Firefox installed, so I cannot even browse with that.</p>
<p>Before I closed IE, I saw that Ayende has <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/08/13/How-.Net-3.5-SP1-broke-Rhino-Mocks.aspx">already posted</a> a Connect bug for SP1.  I’ll tell you what, it seems like he should be a Beta tester for every release and service pack—he always seems to find a way to break something!</p>
