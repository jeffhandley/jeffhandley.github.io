<p>I laughed my ass off at the Redneck email that Jeremy Miller <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2009/09/08/bad-humor-way-off-topic-and-you-know-you-re-going-to-read-it.aspx" target="_blank">posted</a> today.  Here is the content of the email (a series of redneck jokes).  But the best part is what happened when I went to post this to Facebook as a Note.  Look below for a screen shot.</p>  <p><code><font size="1">Dearest Redneck Son,</font></p>    <p><font size="1">I'm writing this slow because I know you can't read fast. We don't live where we did when you left home. Your dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happen within 20 miles of your home, so we moved. I won't be able to send you the address because the last Southwest Missouri family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so they wouldn't have to change their address.</font></p>    <p><font size="1">This place is really nice.. It even has a washing machine. I'm not sure about it. I put a load of clothes in and pulled the chain. We haven't seen them since.</font></p>    <p><font size="1">The weather isn't bad here. It only rained twice last week; the first time for three days and the second time for four days..</font></p>    <p><font size="1">About that coat you wanted me to send; your Uncle Billy Bob said it would be too heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets.</font></p>    <p><font size="1">Bubba locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your father out.</font></p>    <p><font size="1">Your sister had a baby this morning, but I haven't found out what it is yet so I don't know if you are an aunt or uncle.</font></p>    <p><font size="1">Uncle Bobby Ray fell into a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out but he fought them off and drowned. We had him cremated, he burned for three days.</font></p>    <p><font size="1">Three of your friends went off a bridge in a pickup truck. Butch was driving. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. Your other two friends were in the back. They drowned because they couldn't get the tailgate down!</font></p>    <p><font size="1">There isn't much more news at this time. Nothing much out of the normal has happened.</font></p>    <p><font size="1">Your Favorite Aunt,       <br />Mom</font></code></p>  <p><a href="http://jeffhandley.com/images/jeffhandley_com/WindowsLiveWriter/SorryAnthonybutFacebooksaysyoureaRedneck_C081/AnthonyRedneck_2.png" rel="lightbox"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="AnthonyRedneck" border="0" alt="AnthonyRedneck" src="http://jeffhandley.com/images/jeffhandley_com/WindowsLiveWriter/SorryAnthonybutFacebooksaysyoureaRedneck_C081/AnthonyRedneck_thumb.png" width="574" height="259" /></a> </p>  <p>Apparently, Anthony is a redneck.  Sorry Anthony.</p>
