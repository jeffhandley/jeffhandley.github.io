<p>I love <a href="http://www.fox.com/24" target="_blank">Fox's 24</a>.  It looks like we're <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i903d9ca529efbd334f55e59d511cd9e7" target="_blank">not going to have a season 7 in 2008</a> as had been planned, because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike" target="_blank">writer's strike</a>.  But to quench our thirst, Fox has released a clip from the previously unaired pilot for 24.</p>  <p>If you're a 24 fan, <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1788161" target="_blank">go watch the clip</a>.  However be warned that it was shot back in 1994, so the technology is quite a bit different from what we're used to.  It's probably a good thing Fox waited until technology had improved before they premiered the show.</p>  <p>The lack of 24 this season is bittersweet for me.  It's bitter because I love the show and I am looking forward to what they have in store for us.   It's sweet because we ditched our DVR a few months back so I have virtually no chance of watching it right now.  I need to get a cable jack run to where my PC is so that I can use Vista to record the show.  There's no rush on that anymore.</p>  <hr />  <p><em style="font-size: 8pt">No, I don't really think this pilot clip is real, but it was fun to write the post as though I did/it was.  The strike's effect on 24 is most definitely real though.  We probably won't see another 24 episode until January 2009.</em></p>
