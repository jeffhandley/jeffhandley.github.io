<p>A few weeks ago, we took a day trip down to the Mt. Rainier National Park.  We took tons of pictures and some of the views were absolutely spectacular.  At one point, we walked down a trail onto the river bed of the White River, and there was a log bridge going over the river.  The scene was just breathtaking.  I hadn't ever used the Stitch Assist feature on our <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=144&amp;modelid=13077" target="_blank">Canon PowerShot S3 IS</a>, and I decided that was the time to try it out.</p>  <p>I took 3 pictures, using the highest resolution in the "Landscape" mode.  The other night, I finally got around to trying to stitch them together.  I went and grabbed <a href="http://get.live.com/photogallery/overview" target="_blank">Windows Live Photo Gallery</a> for the task, and it did a great job for me.  Here's the result.  This is now the desktop background on my machine at home and at work.  At work, I have resized and rescaled the picture to fit my 3360x1050 needs.</p>  <p><a href="http://blog.jeffhandley.com/Images/PostImages/Myfirstpanoramicpicture_15057/WhiteRiver.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="260" alt="White River Mt.
