<p>For several months, I've been listening to a custom station on <a href="http://www.pandora.com/" target="_blank">Pandora</a>.  I use <a href="http://openpandora.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">OpenPandora</a> too, except I've downloaded the code for OpenPandora and made some changes.  Maybe one day I'll email the project owner and see about getting my changes merged in.</p>  <p>But anyway... for years I listened to CDs that I had ripped.  But my collection grew old.  Then I tried listening to <a href="http://www.webn.com" target="_blank">WEBN</a> online, but the commercials were absurd and annoying.</p>  <p>Pandora is simply amazing.  If you've never tried it, give it a 2-5 day trial and you'll probably never listen to anything else from your PC.</p>  <p><em>By the way, it's Free/Open Source.</em></p>
