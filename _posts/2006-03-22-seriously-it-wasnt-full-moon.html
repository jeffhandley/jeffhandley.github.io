I'm not a big believer in the effects of the moon phases, but yesterday I did find myself asking, "is it a full moon today or what?"  So I checked the moon phase module that Jess has on the <a href="http://jesstedder.com/dev" target="BIG">BIG Developer Community website</a>.  It wasn't even close to a full moon last night.<br /><br />It seemed like it should've been with the strange things that were happening yesterday.<br /><br />First, my client's internet connection went down.  This keeps me and my team from working really at all.  This rarely, and I mean rarely happens.<br /><br />Second, I get a call from my old business partner at WeDoWebStuff.com; he needs my help because one of the servers has crashed.<br /><br />Third, Kelly and I watched The Sopranos, and we taped it for my brother-in-law.  I then needed to watch 24 and record it onto the same tape.  After a miscue, I needed to rewind the tape a little bit to get it back to the right spot.  Of course the VCR cannot rewind, so I tried to eject the tape to put it in the rewinder.  The VCR eats the tape.<br /><br />Fourth, after I watch and record 24 onto a new tape, I go to pull up The Sopranos using HBO On Demand.  But, HBO On Demand won't tune in.  The screen just goes black, and I hear the sound of whatever channel I was previously on.<br /><br />Fifth, so I go to call into Time Warner Cable, and I get the message that they're currently upgrading to a new computer system and their capabilities are limited.<br /><br />All of this seemed quite odd -- nothing on its own is a big deal, but it was just one thing after another yesterday and it caught my attention.
