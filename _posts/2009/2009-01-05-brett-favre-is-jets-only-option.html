<p>I saw Barry Sanders say on ESPN the other day, in response to a question from comedian Kevin James, that Brett Favre is the Jets’ only option for quarterback next year.</p>  <p>Seriously?&#160; I think Favre’s had a great career, but from what I’ve seen just by playing fantasy football for a handful of years, Favre throws a LOT of interceptions.&#160; No disrespect to Favre, but I have a really hard time believing that there isn’t a single other human being on the planet that is a better (available) quarterback than Favre.</p>  <p>Out of all of the college quarterbacks that are graduating this year and vying for NFL contracts: none of them would be better than Favre?</p>  <p>How many billions of people are there in the world?&#160; And there are only like 30 people in the world qualified to be a starting NFL quarterback?&#160; Really?&#160; That just seems impossible.&#160; There has to be someone.</p>
