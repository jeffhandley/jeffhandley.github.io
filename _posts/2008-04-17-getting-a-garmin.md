<p>Since we'll be moving into a city that we don't know, we've decided to acquire a Garmin GPS.  Our realtor let us borrow his while we were in Redmond/Seattle last weekend, and it was very nice.  We had planned to just buy a <a href="http://store.randmcnally.com/product/us+maps/washington/2008+thomas+guide+seattle+and+king+county.do?search=basic&amp;keyword=king%2Bcounty&amp;sortby=bestSellers&amp;page=1" target="_blank">good map</a>, but after using the Garmin, we changed our minds.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=8470792" target="_blank">Garmin nuvi 660</a> is selling for half-off or better right now.  It speaks street names, it has BlueTooth, can receive FM traffic updates, and much, much more.  Looks like that's our winner!</p>
