O.J. Simpson was just found guilty on all 12 counts against him.  When he was arrested, I laughed my ass off and said it would be totally ironic if this would send him to jail for life after he somehow got out of murder.<div><br /></div><div>I remember reading the following quote when he was arrested:</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"   style="  ;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:17px;"><blockquote>I'm O.J. Simpson. How am I going to think that I'm going to rob somebody and get away with it? (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/16/AR2007091600221.html?nav=emailpage">article</a>)</blockquote></span>So, O.J., how's this for karma?  I hope he gets life in prison, just for irony's sake.  And this verdict came 13 years to the day after his acquittal -- awesome!</div>
