I've volunteered with the Cub Scouts for the last 5 years and it's been a great experience.  As I'm winding down my role in the pack, I was asked to write a testimonial about how rewarding it has been to be involved.  Here it is.
</p>
<p><code>
Spending my days working in an office on a computer, I generally declare that I'm not very handy.  As my sons showed interest in building and fixing things, I would often tell them that I was not capable of doing it.  But after 5 years of volunteering with Pack 561, I've learned that in fact, <u><b>I am handy, and I can build and fix things</b></u>!
</p>
<p>
You see, as adults, we tend to know our boundaries; we know what we can and cannot do.  But our children are still learning their boundaries.  And Cub Scouts are taught that in fact, there are no boundaries--you can do whatever you're interested in!  If you want to learn how to whittle, you can!  If you want to learn how to build a Derby car, you can!  If you want to learn how to identify trees, birds, or animal poop, you can!  You can tour a TV station.  You can meet and interview the mayor.  You can experience what it's like to sit in a fire truck or inside a jail cell.  You can learn a little bit about a lot of things so that you can discover what you want to learn more about.
</p>
<p>
When I first started volunteering with Pack 561, I faced some boundaries.  How could I possibly teach children how to build a Derby car when I've never built one myself?  How could I possibly lead them on a trek at the Arboretum, identifying birds, when I can't tell the difference between a cardinal and a robin?  I can't do these things and I'm too old to learn.  But when I saw first-hand the eagerness to learn that our Scouts have, it rubbed off on me.  I can learn how to build a Derby car!  I can learn to identify birds!  <u><b>I can learn all kinds of things</b></u>!
</p>
<p>
I may not have been in Scouts when I was a boy, but I've spent the last 5 years volunteering with the Scouts, and I've learned so much.  But the most important thing I've learned is that I don't have as many boundaries as I thought I had, and I'm not too old to learn about all of the exciting topics that my sons want to learn about themselves.  And just today, I worked with my sons to to take apart and fix two of their toys that have been broken for years.  I used to tell them that I didn't know how to build and fix things, but today I proved to them that <u><b>life isn't about what you know, it's about what you are willing to learn</b></u>.
