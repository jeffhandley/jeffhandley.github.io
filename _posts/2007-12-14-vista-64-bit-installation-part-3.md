<p>I took 2GB RAM out of the machine (to take it to 2GB), then finished the installation, ran Windows Update, and added the RAM back in.  All seems well.  That was a LOT easier than slipstreaming my own Vista installation!</p>  <p>Here are the details for my Vista score:</p>  <ul>   <li>Processor = 4.9 </li>    <li>Memory = 5.9 </li>    <li>Graphics = 3.4 (haven't installed my aftermarket cards yet) </li>    <li>Gaming graphics = 3.0 (same as above, but I don't really care about this one) </li>    <li>Primary hard disk = 5.9 </li> </ul>  <p>I'm sure I'll end up having several posts about my Vista experience while I get software installed.</p>
