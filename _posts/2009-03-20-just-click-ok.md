<p>Something that has always nettled me is watching someone go into a properties dialog, make their changes, click Apply, and then OK.  You do realize that you can just click OK, right?  OK will apply your changes and close the window.  Why did you hit Apply and then OK?</p>  <p>I first started to notice this pattern with non-technical people.  But recently, I’ve seen several developers here at Microsoft do this too.  I’m baffled by this.  Is this a confidence problem?  If so, is the user lacking confidence in his own actions, or confidence in the software he’s using?</p>  <p>Let’s get past this and just click OK when we’re done.</p>
