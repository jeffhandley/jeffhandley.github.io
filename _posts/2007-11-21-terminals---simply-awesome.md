<p>For several months now, I've been using <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Terminals" target="_blank">Terminals</a> for my remote desktop needs.  This is an amazingly great time saver.  I have to remote desktop into several machines each day, many times multiple machines at once.  This tool has probably saved me a few hours since I started using it.</p>  <p>For any of your that have to regularly remote desktop into any machine, or multiple machines, go get Terminals from CodePlex.</p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:8d697b5c-5553-4679-9233-24f33a0bd330" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags:  		<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Remote%20Desktop/" rel="tag">Remote Desktop</a> 		,  		<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Productivity/" rel="tag">Productivity</a> 		</div>
