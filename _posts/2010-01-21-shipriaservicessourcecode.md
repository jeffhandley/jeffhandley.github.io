<p>When I laid out my commitments for the current fiscal year, I included “Ship RIA Services Source Code” as a stretch goal.  Pulling this off will require a ton of effort.  I’ll have to work with management up several levels, with our legal department, and with dozens of others to pull it off.  There will also be a very significant amount of engineering required to make it happen too.  So I’m trying to figure out how valuable this would be to our customers.</p>  <p>Please go rate the value here: <a href="http://twtpoll.com/zfln78" target="_blank">http://twtpoll.com/zfln78</a></p>  <p>I’d also like to hear comments backing up your ratings, so please fire away on this post.  I’d love to see discussion break out on this, so don’t hold back – let me have it.</p>  <ul>   <li>Why is it or is it not valuable to put effort into getting the source code shipped?</li>  <li>What kind of licensing would you expect if the source code was released?</li>  <li>How would you use the source code?</li>  <li>Do you consider shipping source code to be a significant feature for a product?</li>  <li>Would you sacrifice other features to allow this to happen?</li> </ul>  <p>Even if I get 50,000 votes begging to make this happen, I can’t make any promises.  If I pursue this, it’s quite possible that I won’t succeed.  That’s why it’s called a “stretch goal.”  But before I dive into it, I thought I’d make sure it’s worth my (over)time and others’.</p>  <p>Thanks as always for the feedback!</p>
