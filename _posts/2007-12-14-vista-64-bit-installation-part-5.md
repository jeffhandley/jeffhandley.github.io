<p>I rebooted and got another blue screen -- same error.  I took the memory back out, and booted clean again.  Then I downloaded and installed the windows update standalone package available for <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929777">KB929777</a>.  I rebooted to make sure I got a clean reboot with 2GB ram, which I did.  Then I added the RAM back in and I've rebooted a few times just fine.</p>  <p>I think I may finally be in the clear.  What a pain though!</p>
