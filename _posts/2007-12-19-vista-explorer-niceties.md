<p>I've started using a couple of nice features in the Vista Explorer.  First is the 'Favorite Links' area.  This is similar to the 'Favorite Folders' area in Outlook 2007.  Second is 'Use checkboxes to select items' from the View options.</p>  <p>Here is a shot with both items in action:<img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="284" alt="image" src="/img/postimages/VistaExplorerNiceties_15C7/image.png" width="463" border="0" /> </p>  <p>To turn on the checkboxes, hit Organize-&gt;Folder and Search Options.  Then on the View tab, there's an option for "Use checkboxes to select items."  I have only been using this for 10 minutes, but I already love it.</p>
