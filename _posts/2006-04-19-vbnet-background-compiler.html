Just a quick post here... why is it that VS.NET (any version) forces VB.NET to do a background compile as you type your code, and there's no way to turn it off?<br /><br />Those of us working in large solutions are frustrated by this... VS.NET: Let me tell you when to compile!  Why is there no option for this?<br /><br />I have never sent Microsoft feedback on this, so shame on me.  But this is something I wouldn't expect to have to tell them.  Anyone ever found a trick to get around this issue?
