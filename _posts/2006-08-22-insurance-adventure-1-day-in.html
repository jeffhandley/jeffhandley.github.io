<p>When I called the insurance company last night, the gentleman I spoke with (Pat) was extremely polite and very apologetic for the inconvenience caused by the rust problems with my car.&nbsp; He assured me that I would be contacted today before the end of the day by a manager, to discuss how the situation could be addressed.&nbsp; I was quite impressed and satisfied.</p> <p>But alas, the end of the day has arrived, and I have not received a call.&nbsp; I patiently waited all day and just called back in a few minutes ago.&nbsp; This time I spoke with Michelle and she was equally as polite and apologetic as Pat was.&nbsp; She said that the notes that Pat made on my claim very clearly instructed a manager to call my cell phone today.&nbsp; She was going to put another note on the claim.</p> <p>Michelle&nbsp;advised that if I don't get a call by 3:30pm tomorrow, to call in again.&nbsp; Since I called after hours both times, there were no managers available.&nbsp; But if I call tomorrow afternoon and mention that I was expecting a call, they'll get a manager on the phone right away.</p>
