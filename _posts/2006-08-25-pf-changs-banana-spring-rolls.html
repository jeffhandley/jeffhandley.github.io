<p>We ate at PF Changs last night.&nbsp; The last time we ate there, we got the Banana Spring Rolls for dessert, and we loved it.&nbsp; We had to get it again, even though we were stuffed already.</p> <p>As we were eating the dessert, Kelly and I agreed that it's about the best dessert in town.<br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4140/760/1600/BananaSpringRolls.0.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4140/760/400/BananaSpringRolls.0.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /></p>
