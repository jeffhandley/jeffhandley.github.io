While at Best Buy yesterday, I was looking to see if they had the STV2 Kit by any chance.  The first guy I talked to didn't know what I was talking about, but then another guy jumped in and knew exactly what I was referring to.<br /><br />He was the first person I've talked to in awhile to know what I wanted.  He said that they won't be carrying the kit, and that I would likely have to go to the manufacturer to get one.  He pointed me to Directed Electronics, <a href="http://www.directed.com" target="Directed">www.directed.com</a>.<br /><br />He went ahead and pulled up the web site for me, and looked there; he didn't see the kit on their site, so he gave me their phone number: 800-876-0800.<br /><br />As I was walking out of the store, I called this number and was put on hold... call will be answered in the order received, blah blah blah.  Then I drove to the mall and continued with my Christmas shopping.  I kid you not... I let the phone sit on hold for about an hour and a half.  Thank goodness for speaker phone on the cell phone.  I was almost home when I decided to end the call.  Every 10 minutes or so, it told me that I could press 2 to leave a message, so that's what I did.  I doubt I'll get a call back, but who knows.<br /><br />This seems like one of the best leads yet, hopefully it's not a dead end.
