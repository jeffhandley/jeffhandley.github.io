<p>Scientists are mapping the DNA of the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/science/11/19/mammoth.dna/index.html" target="_blank">woolly mammoth</a>.&#160; They’re talking about how they could bring the animal back from extinction.&#160; Seriously?&#160; You saw that movie, right?&#160; Yeah, sure, they were dinosaurs, but my guess is that a woolly mammoth could eat you too.&#160; Maybe extinction was their ploy for survival… by going extinct, they could bypass thousands of years of bad climates; and now that the climate is satisfactory to them again, they’ll come back to life and take over the planet.</p>
