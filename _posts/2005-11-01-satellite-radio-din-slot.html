Okay, in shopping for satellite radio equipment, I've gotten pretty frustrated.  I have an open DIN slot in my dash board, and I'd love to plop a satellite receiver in there and wire it to my head unit.  Then I should be able to detach the satellite receiver and bring it inside the house to plug into the home docking station.<br /><br />Apparently, this isn't an option with any of the receivers.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.crutchfield.com/S-W7LdNx7ft5l/cgi-bin/ProdView.asp?g=247350&I=607ST2" target="sirius">Sirius Starmate Replay</a> would fit within a DIN slot as it's 5" x 1.9", and the <a href="http://akamaipix.crutchfield.com/Manuals/607/607ST2.PDF" target="sirius">owner's manual</a> references an optional car kit (STV2) within the installation section.  The manual states that the kit includes a DIN-compatible install plate -- perfect!  However, this item is not available for purchase anywhere and Sirius customer support has no records of such a product -- joy!  I was given the number to product support, 800-869-5590.  Hopefully they'll have records of this thing.<br /><br />I'm leaning toward the Starmate Replay regardless of the install plate though.  I will probably end up crafting some sort of an install plate myself, making this much more of a project than I wanted it to be, but oh well.
