Well,<br /><br />As promised, I received the car kit today... it's packaged very nicely :-)  I can hardly believe that this thing actually exists!<br /><br />Thank you again to <a href="http://www.thesiriusstore.com" target="store">TheSiriusStore.com</a> for the awesome hookup.<br /><br />I will say though... this isn't exactly what I was expecting... this appears to be designed for a permanent car installation, not so that you can take the receiver in an out of the car.  I guess that explains the 3 wire hookups instead of a docking port.<br /><br />The receiver is recessed into the plate, almost completely, which will make it look very slick in the dash.  The DIN plate does not screw into the car at all, it supposedly just snaps into an open DIN slot.  I'm not sure how that's going to work out.<br /><br />I hope to install this thing on Saturday... so I will post an update once I've got it set up.
