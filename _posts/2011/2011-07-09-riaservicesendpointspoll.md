<p>The RIA Services team is planning out some V2 features.  One common question that keeps coming up as we’re discussing ideas is how much people are using the “extra” 3 endpoints that we provide: OData, JSON, and SOAP.</p>  <p>If you don’t know, the official RIA Services product contained the default binary endpoint as well as an OData endpoint.  However, the OData endpoint doesn’t support client-side queries, or the ability to submit changes.  With those limitations, the uses of the endpoint are certainly limited.  The RIA Services Toolkit contains the JSON and SOAP endpoints.</p>  <p>My question to you is: Do you use the OData, JSON, or SOAP endpoints?  If so, what for?</p>
