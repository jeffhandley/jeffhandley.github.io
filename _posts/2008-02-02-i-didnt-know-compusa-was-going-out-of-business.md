<p>I must live under a rock.  CompUSA <a href="http://www.fool.com/news/associated-press/2007/12/07/compusa-to-close-stores-after-holidays.aspx" target="_blank">is closing its stores</a>.  I stopped by tonight on my way home from work to pick up a wireless router and PCI card for my mother-in-law's <a href="http://blog.jeffhandley.com/archive/2008/01/30/wow-dell-is-fast.aspx" target="_blank">new Dell</a>, and they had store closing signs all over the front of the building.  The shelves were near empty, but I managed to get some of the last (on-the-cheap-side) wireless stuff they had.</p>  <p>I'll be sad to see this store go as I've always shopped there.  The <a href="http://www.microcenter.com/" target="_blank">MicroCenter</a> near us feels like a warehouse inside, instead of a nice, bright store, and their prices have always seemed to be higher than CompUSA's.  But I guess I'll have to start going there when I need to pick something up.</p>
