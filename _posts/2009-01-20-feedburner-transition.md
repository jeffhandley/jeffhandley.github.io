<p>It was time to move my blog feed from FeedBurner to Google.  I’ve been worried about this transition after seeing Phil Haack share <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2008/12/11/the-feedburner-to-google-domain-transition-foul-up.aspx" target="_blank">his nightmare</a> about this.  Here’s to hoping that this post shows up in everyone’s reader!</p>
