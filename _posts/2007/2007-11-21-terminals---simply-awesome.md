<p>For several months now, I've been using <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Terminals" target="_blank">Terminals</a> for my remote desktop needs.  This is an amazingly great time saver.  I have to remote desktop into several machines each day, many times multiple machines at once.  This tool has probably saved me a few hours since I started using it.</p>  <p>For any of your that have to regularly remote desktop into any machine, or multiple machines, go get Terminals from CodePlex.</p>
