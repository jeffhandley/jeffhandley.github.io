<p>I sent this message to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.visiontek.com/">VisionTek</a>:</p>
<p>I purchased 2 Radeon X1300 cards for use on a new Dell OptiPlex 740 with Vista 64-bit.  The machine is running an AMD 64 X2 Dual Core 4200+ 2.20GHz processor and I have 4GB RAM.  I have 3 Dell 198FP 19" flat panels. </p>
<p>I have been having a hard time getting drivers running with a quality display.  Screen painting is slow and as I move things around, there is a lot of "pixel poop" left behind. </p>
<p>If I remove one of the cards, everything works great on 2 monitors (one hooked to the DVI with a DVI-VGA adapter and the other hooked directly to the VGA port).  But as soon as I introduce the 2nd card, I can't get a quality display. </p>
<p>The driver that is presently installed shows as: </p>
<p>Radeon X1300 / X1550 Series </p>
<p>Provider: ATI Technologies Inc. <br />
Date: 11/1/2007 <br />
8.432.0.0 </p>
<p>I have tried other flavors of the driver, including those provided by Microsoft, and I end up with the same result each time I put the 2nd card in. </p>
<p>Please advise on how to run 2 of these cards. </p>
<p>Thanks, <br />
Jeff Handley</p>
