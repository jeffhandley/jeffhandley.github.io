<p>I met with my project manager today and we discussed my formal responsibilities on DASL.  I've recently been working on <a href="http://jeffhandley.com/archive/2007/11/07/my-work-pace.aspx" target="_blank">stabilizing my work pace</a>, and in order to do so, it's important to know what the heck I'm <em>supposed</em> to be doing.</p>  <p>About a month ago, I met with my boss, one of the owners of BIG, and we discussed this kind of stuff too.  But now that we have some time behind us after I delegated some things away, it was great to review what I've been doing and actually document it--very refreshing actually.</p>  <p><em>(Updated 12/6/2007 to reflect some fine tuning by my boss)</em></p>  <ol>   <li>Application Development  <ol type="a">   <li>Technical architecture and design </li>  <li>Define best practices and standard design patterns </li>  <li>Ensure code quality  <ol type="i">   <li>Adherence to standards </li>  <li>Maintainability </li>  <li>Performance and efficiency </li>   </ol>   </li>  <li>Provide design direction </li>  <li>Technology, platform and tool selection </li>  <li>Manage technical aspects of software integrations </li>  <li>Advanced development projects </li>  <li>Provide technical direction for future development and projects </li>   </ol>   </li>  <li>Developer Management  <ol type="a">   <li>Provide work estimates </li>  <li>Maintain developer task assignments </li>  <li>Track developer activity and status </li>  <li>Ensure established development timelines are met </li>  <li>Development support  <ol type="i">   <li>Facilitate developer success </li>  <li>Mentor junior developers </li>  <li>Ensure appropriate skill growth </li>   </ol>   </li>   </ol>   </li>  <li>Builds, deployments and internal environments  <ol type="a">   <li>Support and manage creation and maintenance of all internal development, support and QA environments </li>  <li>Support and manage internal and production builds </li>  <li>Select, create and support build tools, utilities and automation </li>  <li>Production code deployments </li>   </ol>   </li>  <li>Analysis and field support  <ol type="a">   <li>Maintain and administer the DASL QAPR website </li>  <li>Advanced technical support as necessary </li>  <li>Internal subject matter expert support </li>   </ol>   </li> </ol>  <p>While trying to document the list, I went to my desk and grabbed a month's worth of <a href="http://jeffhandley.com/archive/2007/12/03/task-tracking.aspx" target="_blank">task tracker sheets</a> to make sure that everything I've been doing was covered in the list.</p>
