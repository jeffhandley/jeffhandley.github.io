<p>Glenn Block and I have been working together on the ViewModel pattern.  We’ve been trying to identify the biggest pain points associated with the pattern, with the goal of adding framework support to alleviate the pain.  Tonight, Glenn posted, <a target="_blank" href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/glenn.block/archive/2009/05/04/view-model-the-movie-cast-your-vote.aspx">“View Model” – the movie, cast your vote</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to use our new friend <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow.com</a> to gather some feedback.  So here it is: <a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/823992/what-are-the-biggest-pain-points-with-the-viewmodel-pattern">What are the biggest pain points with the ViewModel pattern?</a></p>
<p>Please participate in this StackOverflow.com poll for how the framework can better support the ViewModel pattern!</p>
