<p>The tools that I've <a href="http://oldblog.jeffhandley.com/index.php/2006/05/23/free-pdf-printing/" target="_blank">previously used</a> for printing to PDF haven't been working for me in Vista.  Upon a quick <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=print+to+pdf+vista+64" target="_blank">Google search</a>, I found <a href="http://matthewdarnell.blogspot.com/2007/10/create-pdf-files-in-vista-64-bit.html" target="_blank">this article</a> that links to <a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/Products/CutePDF/writer.asp" target="_blank">CutePDF</a>.  I had CutePDF installed and working in Vista x64 in less than 2 minutes.  And it's free.  Excellent!</p>
