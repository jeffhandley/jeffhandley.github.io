Okay... I was just telling someone about the idea that <a href="http://jeffhandley.blogspot.com/2006/03/found-new-time-saver.html">I was blogging about</a>.  He asked if I had ever used Slickrun... I didn't know what it was, but I quickly found it through <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>.  I have had this installed for < 5 minutes and I already LOVE it!<br /><br />I always have my taskbar running at 2 rows of height.  But I have always hated that the space under the start button was unusable.  Well -- no longer true.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jeffhandley.com/jeffhandley/_Images/Slickrun.jpg" target="_blank">See a screen shot here</a>.<br /><br />You can find Slickrun here: <a href="http://www.bayden.com/SlickRun/">http://www.bayden.com/SlickRun</a><br /><br />I expect this to be another great time saver.
