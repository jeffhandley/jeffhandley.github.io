<p><a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin/default.aspx" target="_blank">Karl Seguin</a> is off to a great start with his series on Foundations of Programming.  He posted <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin/archive/2007/11/29/foundations-of-programming-pt-2-domain-domain-domain.aspx" target="_blank">Part 2</a> today and it's a great read.  I look forward to the remainder of the series.</p>
