<p>I'm having pretty good success with Windows Live Writer &amp; Blogger.&nbsp; Just one problem so far... Blogger doesn't support having images posted, darn!</p> <p>But I love that Windows Live Writer allows you to create blog entries and see what it would look like formatted on your blog while you type.&nbsp; And then you can preview the entry as well, which it does a great job with.</p>
