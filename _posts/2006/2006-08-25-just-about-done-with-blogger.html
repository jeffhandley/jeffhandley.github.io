<p>Blogger is ticking me off.&nbsp; My atom.xml got all out of whack again today.&nbsp; I am trying to republish my blog again in hopes that corrects the issue again, but the web site is having major issues for me.</p> <p><a href="http://jesstedder.com" target="_blank">Jess Tedder</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://jeffhandley.blogspot.com/2006/08/windows-live-writer-and-blogger.html#comments" target="_blank">said</a> he thinks <a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> is the best blogging platform out there.&nbsp; I may try to migrate over there.</p> <p>I wonder if there is any way to export blog entries out of blogger and import them into WordPress.</p>
