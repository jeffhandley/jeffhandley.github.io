<p>This is way off topic, but I have a feeling I'm going to need to rant about this for weeks to come... and where better to do that but here?</p> <p>I have a 2000 Subaru Impreza 2.5RS.&nbsp; I got it at the end of November 1999.&nbsp; In early April 2000, I got hit pretty hard by someone that fell asleep and crossed the double-yellow.&nbsp; He hit my driver door at 45mph at a 45° angle.&nbsp; I had tried to swerve out of the way by going onto the shoulder, so when he hit me, it slammed my car into the guardrail.&nbsp; Not good.&nbsp; I walked away, but my car was messed up pretty good.</p> <p>The car was taken to a body shop (I will refrain from mentioning their name).&nbsp; It took a little over 3 months to get all of the parts from Subaru, so the car sat, disassembled, for that time.&nbsp; Once all of the parts arrived, it took the shop another&nbsp;3 months to put the car back together.&nbsp; When I got it back, I immediately had to give it back to them as one of the control arms was bent and the car was pulling to one side.&nbsp; The shop wouldn't take responsibility for this, so I had to pay to fix that out of pocket, which sucked.&nbsp; They had the car for another couple of weeks.&nbsp; In the end, they shop had the car for 6½ months.&nbsp; Luckily, the insurance company paid for a rental car for the first 5½ months of all of that.</p> <p>Well, here we are 6½ years later.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, I noticed some interesting rust along the edge of the quarter panel where the trunk lid is.&nbsp; After further investigation, I found that the quarter panel is rusting from the inside out, and it's bad.&nbsp; I took the car to the dealer body shop this morning for an estimate.&nbsp; His immediate assessment was that the rust is a result of poor workmanship from when the car was repaired years ago.&nbsp; He also found rust in the door jamb where the quarter panel starts.&nbsp; He advised me to contact the insurance company that paid for the repairs because they should be liable for this problem.</p> <p>So, when I get home, I will be looking up my claim number from the accident and contacting the insurance company (which will also remain nameless for the time being).&nbsp; But for some reason, I don't think they are going to willingly and happily pay for the rust problems to be fixed.&nbsp; So I'm expecting this to be quite the battle.</p>
