As promised, <a href="http://www.TheSiriusStore.com" target="Store">TheSiriusStore.com</a> has the car kits available for purchase on their site.<br /><br />The product is being released as the car kit for the Streamer GTR... no idea why the Starmate is apparently discontunued and replaced with the Streamer GTR, but oh well.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.thesiriusstore.com/images/SIRGTRV1.jpg" /><br /><br />It appears as though the receiver will be slightly recessed into the dash, which is great... but it doesn't look like there's anything special for organizing the wires...  In fact, it almost looks like the wires could fall back into the dash if you're not careful.  We'll see.<br /><br />To purchase the kit, visit <a href="http://www.thesiriusstore.com/streamer-professional-vehicle-sirgtrv1-p-321.html" target="Store">http://www.thesiriusstore.com/streamer-professional-vehicle-sirgtrv1-p-321.html</a>.<br /><br />You'll notice that it's priced at $29.99... and not the $9.99 as advertised on <a href="http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius/CachedPage&c=ProductAsset&cid=1131556293930" target="Sirius">www.sirius.com</a>.  But I think we had come to the conclusion that the $9.99 price couldn't be correct.
