<p>Okay, I'm trying to marry 2 of my new tools together, <a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" target="_blank">FlexWiki</a> and <a href="http://www.llblgen.com" target="_blank">LLBLGen</a>.&nbsp; Since we're in the requirements and design phase of the project, our DB schema is changing daily.&nbsp; The DB architect on my team is scurrying to keep the database documentation updated on the wiki with each day's changes.</p> <p>The PM thought there would have to be some way to generate the wiki documentation from the database.&nbsp; When the DB architect and I were chatting about it today, I thought using LLBLGen might be a good concept.&nbsp; The LLBLGen project already knows everything about the database for its code generation, including how the database is mapped into the application code.</p> <p>So I've started creating an LLBLGen template that will create wiki files for us.&nbsp; Anyone else married an O/RM tool to a wiki tool before?</p>
