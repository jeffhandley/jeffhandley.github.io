<p><a href="http://software.ericsink.com/" target="_blank">Eric Sink</a> has a great blog!&nbsp; He <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/articles/Compensation.html" target="_blank">just posted</a> another article that made me laugh out loud.&nbsp; For those of you who don't know him, here's a blurb from his <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/about_author.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> page:</p> <blockquote> <p>Prior to founding SourceGear, I was at Spyglass (now OpenTV) for around five years. I served there as Project Lead for the browser team. We <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html">built</a> the original versions of the browser you now know as "Internet Explorer".</p></blockquote> <p>I highly recommend subscribing to Eric's blog, and even reading all of his old posts (there aren't a ton).</p>
