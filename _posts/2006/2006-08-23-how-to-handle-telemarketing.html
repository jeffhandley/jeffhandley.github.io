<p><a href="http://jesstedder.com" target="_blank">Jess Tedder</a>&nbsp;just sent me <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~egbg/counterscript.html" target="_blank">this link</a>.&nbsp; It's a counterscript for responding to telemarketers.&nbsp; Great stuff.</p> <p>Here are some of my stories.</p> <hr> <strong>Cincinnati Enquirer Salesperson: </strong>May I ask why you're not interested in a (newspaper) subscription?<br><strong>Me (sobbing): </strong>Because I can't read okay! <hr> <strong>Home Improvements&nbsp;Salesperson: </strong>blah, blah, blah, buy our windows and doors<br><strong>Me: </strong>Although I appreciate your call, my house does not have any windows or doors.&nbsp; We're pretty poor.<br><strong>Home Improvements Salesperson (sarcastic): </strong>Oh, I see... blah, blah, blah, we also do carpeting.<br><strong>Me: </strong>Well, we're not interested in that either; we have dirt floors.&nbsp; Like I said, we're poor.<br> <hr>  My wife led a magazine salesperson on for about 15-20 minutes, picking out a dozen magazines that she would like to buy, seemingly very excited that the person called.&nbsp; Then the salesperson was ready to collect payment information. <p><strong>Magazine Salesperson: </strong>Okay, I need to confirm that you are at least 18 years old.<br><strong>Kelly: </strong>Oh, I'm not.&nbsp; I'm only 14.<br><strong>Magazine Salesperson:</strong> Oh.&nbsp; Well, is your mom or dad home so that they could confirm your order?<br><strong>Kelly: </strong>Oh gosh, they would never let me buy all of these magazines.<br><strong>Magazine Salesperson:</strong> Oh.<br><strong>Kelly (whining): </strong>Does this mean I won't get my magazines?</p>
