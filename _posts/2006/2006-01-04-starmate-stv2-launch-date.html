Here's the scoop, with the story following...<br /><b><br />The Sirius Starmate Replay STV2 (Optional Dash-Mount/DIN-Compatible) will be made available for online purchase from <a href="http://shop.sirius.com" target="shopsirius">shop.sirius.com</a> on January 9th!</b><br /><hr noshade size="1" style="color:black;display:block;visibility:visible;">I called Sirius Customer Service again last night, to check in on the STV2.  After sitting on hold for a few minutes, I spoke with a gentleman that had never heard of the STV2.  I told him to do a Google search for "starmate stv2" and click on the first link -- which is the easiest way to get to the product details.  Then I told him the following:<br /><br />- It's on the main Sirius website<br />- It's not available for online purchase from Sirius and I was told it won't be available for online purchase -- it'll have to be purchased from a retailer<br />- Circuit City, Best Buy, Crutchfield and Radio Shack have all told me that they won't be carrying the product<br /><br />I asked how and where to get one.  After putting me on hold for a few minutes, he came back and gave me a phone number for the Starmate and Sportster receivers' product support.  He said that this is separate from general Sirius product support as it's actually a separate company that manages the Starmate and the Sportster.  This number was 800-869-5187.<br /><br />So I called this number and sat on hold for about 30 minutes before getting to speak with someone.  I wish the hold music had been Octane instead of StarLite, but oh well.  When I finally spoke with someone, I repeated to her what I had told the gentleman that sent me her way.  She put me on hold for a few minutes and came back with wonderful news...<br /><br />Because retailers have decided not to sell the product, Sirius will be selling it online.  It will be launched on their website on January 9th... I guess the 9th will be a big day for them.<br /><br />I will certainly be listening to Sirius on the 9th, but I'll also be checking their website for this product's availability.
