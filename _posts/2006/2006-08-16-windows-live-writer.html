<p>I've decided to give <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%21D85741BB5E0BE8AA%21174.entry" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a>&nbsp;a try.&nbsp; Blogger has a decent enough web-based blog editor, but the thick-client features could be quite useful.&nbsp; This is my first post with it, we'll see how it goes.</p>
