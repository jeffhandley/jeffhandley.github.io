Back in 2003, I had the pleasure of contributing to an exciting project: **StatsWorld Fantasy Football**. I had been a passive fan of American Football my whole life, but I'd never _studied_ the game and I'd never participated in _fantasy sports_. Working on StatsWorld gave me the opportunity to learn how fantasy sports worked, how fun they could be, and to gain a deeper knowledge of American Football and the NFL.

<img src="/img/postimages/2023/statsworld-box-front.jpg" align="right" alt="A software box front containing StatsWorld Football SMARTs PC software for both commissioners and coaches" />

I joined Business Integration Group (BIG) in February of 2003 and was tasked with building the UI layer of StatsWorld using ASP.NET. I'd already put several large line-of-business applications into production using ASP.NET by that time, and Business Integration Group hired me to help solidify their position in the Cincinnati area as leaders in ASP.NET. StatsWorld was an internally-funded project meant to showcase the company's expertise and capabilities.

StatsWorld Fantasy Football wasn't an entirely new project for BIG though; the family-owned business had been in the Fantasy Football industry for over a decade, with roots going back much farther than that. As I recall their family had been organizing and operating Fantasy Football leagues since the 1970s, and the operation became progressively computerized over the years. In the 1990s they were selling Windows PC software for managing leagues, with good old-fashioned, off-the-shelf software boxes containing disks and manuals. They sold thousands of copies each year and it was profitable.

And then came the internet. Yahoo! was an early player in the fantasy sports market--offering _free_, web-based leagues for many sports including football. Other web-based offerings were emerging as well, and the writing was on the wall for StatsWorld: "How do we compete with 'free'?" But then a combination of events occurred that invited StatsWorld into the online arena.

CBS Sportsline Fanstasy Football launched, and they were charging $79 per league per year. Sure, CBS was able to plug their own offering during game broadcasts, but their feature set was weak and you still had to tolerate ads. Other offerings followed suit and began pushing paid leagues too. And the clincher for Business Integration Group's decision to take StatsWorld online was the release of the .NET Framework and ASP.NET 1.0. With ASP.NET, a web-based StatsWorld could be affordably built. The project started in January 2003 with the deadline of being live in time for the football season later that year.

A half-dozen of us worked together to build StatsWorld, and we succeeded. We launched during the summer, sold a few thousand leagues, fixed some bugs during the 4-week preseason, and we were ready for regular-season week 1. In about 7 months, we built an industry-leading, web-based offering that was free of advertisements, profitable, easy to use, beautiful, and virtually bug-free.

For the first half of the season, we all worked in the office together during games, monitoring the system and building out the post-season and end-of-season features. We received real-time stats feeds, converted NFL stats into fantasy points, and served over a million page views per hour during live games. We hired my best friend, Chris Ellison, to take care of customer support. Call volume was low enough that Chris could single-handedly provide support to tens of thousands of fantasy coaches on his own, with over 99% of support requests being resolved by helping commissioners correct their fantasy scoring rules to have the desired behavior.

The typical StatsWorld player would log in Tuesday morning and be ready for the week's final results to post at 9:00am ET. Did their fantasy team outscore their friend's? Would their QB earn the front-page headline on the league's fantasy newspaper with the 4 touchdowns they threw? What quote would be generated by StatsWorld for them to describe their fantasy match-up? What players were expected to be on the waiver wire that week? Were any of their players added to the injured reserve list? Many StatsWorld players would _print_ this fantasy newspaper in order to read it. We knew they did, because some of the bugs we fixed were related to page-breaks.

By the 2nd half of the season, StatsWorld ran itself. Each of us on the engineering team began transitioning to consulting projects BIG worked on. We passively monitored the system during games but we were eventually doing so from home. We watched playoff games together in the office, but we rarely had any issues. We brainstormed on features for season 2, which we would allot some time for, but we generally focused on automating everything possible so that StatsWorld could run and grow without any of us having to touch it anymore. One other engineer and I built a live, online draft feature for season two, and after that StatsWorld was _finished_.

I moved on to other projects with BIG and then I joined Microsoft in 2008. I kept playing fantasy football using StatsWorld and I was planning to run a league with my new colleagues at Microsoft. Then I got a call from one of the owners of BIG; they told me they sold StatsWorld to MyFantasyLeague.com. I forget if it was Scott, John, or Steve Drew that called me, but they thanked me for helping make StatsWorld a success.

_Side note: Scott, John, and Steve drew are all twin brothers. And yes, I mean twins not triplets. Can you figure it out?_

Most StatsWorld leagues operated by having each coach pitch in $10 per year, with one or more of the coaches serving as league commissioners. The league would agree to scoring rules, the commissioner(s) would configure the league, and StatsWorld would operate their league through the season. It's actually based on how bowling leagues run. The last bowling league I participated in cost $20 per week, $12 of which went "to the house" (the bowling alley). At the end of the season, I received $180 in prizes. I know a lot of StatsWorld players did the same with their fantasy football leagues, but this was money exchanged between league players. Just like how my bowling alley is completely uninvolved in our league's prize money, neither was StatsWorld. All of StatsWorld's annual income was made before the season started, so we built it with the objective of having low enough maintenance costs that it would be self-sustaining year over year. That was a business model I can stand behind. MyFantasyLeague.com operated similarly, so I was happy with the acquisition.

Nonetheless, I decided not to set up a league with MyFantasyLeague.com, and I've not played fantasy football since then. I will always fondly remember the experience of building StatsWorld. It's one of the highest-quality pieces of software I've ever worked on, and we had a blast building it. After working on hundreds of prior consulting projects across scores of business domains, fantasy football stood out as unique and exciting to me. I learned a lot, continued building a strong .NET-oriented career afterward. I helped propel fantasy football with an offering that was affordable, reliable, scalable, ad-free, and fun. I was proud of StatsWorld and having been a part of the fantasy football industry.

Watching the wild card playoff games in the year 2023 though, I feel differently. I've grown saddened and sickened by fantasy football. Each year, and seemingly each week this season, I've seen a substantial increase in promotions of "fantasy football" through a completely different breed of services. Players on these services don't look forward to the weekly fantasy newspaper; they are lured into the game with $150 in "free bets." Players aren't vying for bragging rights at the water cooler, they're just gambling now. The fantasy football industry has morphed into a predatory market.

NFL broadcasts are saturated with commercials for these betting apps. The networks and sportscasters have to plug these gambling services during game breaks and halftime coverage. Fantasy scores are integrated into smart TVs. And two blocks from my home, there's a billboard for the leading football betting app. That billboard used to advertise a local business but now it's preying on people in my community. These apps don't make their money by selling leagues to groups of friends; they are just casinos who have hijacked a fun game. They don't print fantasy newspapers with coaches' make-believe quotes, they print themselves money with coaches' hard-earned paychecks.

I used to talk about StatsWorld and fantasy football with glee. I used to promote fantasy sports as being wholesome and fun. But now I'm ashamed of what the industry has devolved into, and I can't discuss fantasy sports or StatsWorld without defending its history and the part I played in it.

As each year passes the evidence of StatsWorld's existence further decays and there's little about it remaining on the internet. I can only hope that this post lives as long as I do and this history can survive longer than it otherwise would have. I would like to hope that fantasy sports will one day revert back to what it used to be, but I'm doubtful. If you are ever tempted to play fantasy sports, please recognize that like any other casino the house will always have an advantage. Offering you $150 in "free bets" is just as obvious as serving free steak in the casino restaurant.

#### Fantasy Newspaper

The fantasy newspaper feature I built for StatsWorld was adopted into the feature set of MyFantasyLeague.com as their 'Fantasy Recaps'. Here's an example:

> StatsWorld had similar roots as we did by starting out in the 90's with a PC-based league management system called **SMARTs**, which was a lot like our own **FFLM** client side league management system. Then in 2003 they transitioned from a PC-based program to an on-line system that was more like MyFantasyLeague.com. During the Spring of this season, we worked with them to transition all of their leagues over to MyFantasyLeague.com, and we're excited to provide their leagues with the same feature-rich environment and high level of satisfaction that they've been accustomed to over the years with StatsWorld.
