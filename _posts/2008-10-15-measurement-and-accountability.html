Commit early and often, that's what I say.  It offers measurement and accountability.  If I make a bug fix or create a <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">feature</span> and check it in, and things break, I know what caused the problem.  If I check in 512 unrelated tasks all at the same time, and things get fucked up, then I have no idea where to point my finger.  For that matter, I might even question whether things are really fucked up or if they are now working by design because of all of the changes.<br /><br />Checking code in small chunk at a time ensures measurement and accountability.  I guess that's why congress always lumps 512 issues together into one bill, even though they are utterly unrelated.  Who in congress would want to possibly be measured or held accountable?<br /><br />And you must go check this out: <a href="http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2008/10/15/senator-kyl-responds-to-my-letter.aspx">http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2008/10/15/senator-kyl-responds-to-my-letter.aspx</a>.  The response Tim got from his senator inspired my post.
