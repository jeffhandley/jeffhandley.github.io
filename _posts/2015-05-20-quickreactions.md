While working through sample after sample for Node.js and React.js, I experienced a pattern that wasn’t very helpful. Instead of truly starting from scratch, the samples kept walking through step-by-step of cloning a working solution. They’d start with “Step 1: paste this fully-working code into this file” and “Step 2: paste this fully-working code into this other file.” I was having a hard time finding a breakdown of the concepts being applied.

<p>
I wanted to learn by starting truly from scratch and building the app up in logical, incremental steps.  To accomplish the goal of learning this new material one concept at a time, I created a new project and then documented each new concept that was introduced in a giant README.md file.  I then transformed the giant README into a 19-step tutorial web site using GitHub Pages.
