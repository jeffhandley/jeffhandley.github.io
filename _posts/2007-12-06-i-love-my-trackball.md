<p>Earlier this year, I started experiencing some hand and finger problems including pain and numbness.  I was noticing it most near the end of a long day, and while using my mouse.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=052"><img height="115" alt="Wireless Optical Mouse 5000" src="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/images/mouse/ps_M-wOpt5k-plat.jpg" width="130" align="right" border="0" /></a>For a long time, I had been using (and loving) the Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 5000. I can't stand wired mice, and Optical is a must, so this mouse was a good fit for me.  But, having 3 screens requires a lot of mouse movement, even with very high mouse speed.</p>  <p>When I mentioned my hand pain to Chris Spiess (coworker), he suggested switching to a trackball.  He had hand problems many years ago, but they had subsided after switching to a trackball.  I wasn't persuaded yet though.  I had tried working at Chris's computer before, and I couldn't stand using the trackball.  Using his computer made me feel like I was trying to draw a portrait with my left hand (I'm incredibly inept with my left hand).  I didn't think I'd be able to adjust to the trackball.</p>  <p>About a week later though, Chris was out of the office for the day.  I asked if I could borrow his trackball and try it at my station.  What a difference!  It turns out that my clumsiness with the trackball before was just because I was sitting at his desk, using his keyboard, from his chair.  There were too many factors and overall, I was uncomfortable.  At my workstation however, the trackball was very natural.  I purchased one that very day; the same one he had--a Kensington Optical Expert Trackball Mouse 7.0 with scroll ring.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009KH63/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img"><img height="130" alt="Kensington Expert Mouse Optical USB Trackball for PC or Mac 64325" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CHKD0F7KL._SS130_.jpg" width="130" align="right" border="0" /></a>This device is awesome.  The scroll ring is very, very nice.  The programmable buttons are slick too.  I have the upper-left button programmed as a double-click, which saves time and frustration many times.  The click-lock is programmed as the combo of the bottom 2 buttons--and that's handy when moving windows.  I love being able to just flick my fingers and move the cursor across 2 screens, even moving windows this way.  I've gotten to be very precise with the trackball--more so than I could've ever gotten with a mouse.  Best of all though: no hand or finger problems while computing anymore.</p>  <p>If you have a coworker that uses a trackball, see if you can borrow it at your station one day while he or she is out of the office.  I've converted <a href="http://www.jesstedder.com/" target="_blank">Jess Tedder</a> by letting him borrow mine.  He and I are both very happy we made the switch.  And, thanks to Chris for the advice!</p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:fcf4b7b6-9dcc-4b59-9639-7dd8dfc100c6" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Trackball" rel="tag">Trackball</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Mouse" rel="tag">Mouse</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Ergonomics" rel="tag">Ergonomics</a></div>
