<p>I was completely annoyed by IE8’s accelerators until just a few moments ago.  I like this, very much:</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://blog.jeffhandley.com/images/blog_jeffhandley_com/WindowsLiveWriter/ImightlikeIE8Acceleratorsafterall_C4BF/image_3.png" width="585" height="343" /> </p>  <p>So long merriam-webster.com search provider (which is so unusable that I’m not even going to make that a link).</p>
