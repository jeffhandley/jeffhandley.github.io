Continuing my thoughts on the sweeter bailout...  If the deal needs to be sweetened, then maybe it shouldn't pass.  If the bailout cannot be accepted on its own, then maybe congress should re-think whether or not they should be trying to push it through.<br /><br />I'm very, very anxious about our system trying to solve this problem so quickly.  They are trying to rush something through.  We all know that when you rush something, you'll make mistakes.  Also, by rushing it through, it doesn't allow our representatives to hear from their constituents.
