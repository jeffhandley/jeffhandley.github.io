<p>Someone that's been working for BIG for a long time has recently joined my project.  She and I have overlapped a little bit here and there, but haven't officially worked together on a project before.</p>  <p>She just told me that she likes my approach to code, but I responded that I wasn't sure I had a single approach.  She then came back with this: "<font style="background-color: #ffffff">An impulse towards perfection tempered by realism and experience."</font></p>  <p>I take that as a huge compliment.  We'll see if she still thinks that after working on our million-line monster for awhile!</p>
