<p>Well, I <a href="http://jeffhandley.com/archive/2007/12/21/video-card-woes.aspx" target="_blank">wrote VisionTek</a> on December 21, and I haven't heard back from them yet.</p>  <p>So, I just sent the same message to ATI directly.  We'll see if they have the courtesy to respond.</p>  <p>The box for the card touts the ability to run 2 of the cards and control up to 4 monitors.  I am thinking that in order to do that effectively, I'll need to be running off the DVI ports only and not one of the VGA ports.  This would require a DVI-I to dual VGA splitter Y cable.  I hunted around a bit and was having a hard time finding those online though.</p>
