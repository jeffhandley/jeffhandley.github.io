<p>Zookeepers had been baffled by 2 polar bears that wouldn’t mate.&#160; They finally got to the bottom of the matter by putting one of the bears under anesthesia and looking at its, well, bottom.&#160; They found that the male polar bear isn’t a male at all—he is a female.&#160; That explains why s/he won’t mate with the other female.&#160; Astonishing!&#160; Good thing it only took 5 months to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/26/japan.bears/index.html" target="_blank">solve this “mystery.”</a></p>
