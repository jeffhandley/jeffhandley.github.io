<p>When we <a href="http://jeffhandley.com/archive/2008/04/06/leaving-big-and-relocating.aspx" target="_blank">moved</a> to the greater Seattle area, we knew we’d be in for some rain.&#160; They don’t call it Mt. Rainier for nothing – it’s rainier here than most places.&#160; But there was an aspect of Seattle that we didn’t quite expect—the dark side of Seattle.</p>  <p>I don’t mean “dark” figuratively.&#160; I mean it quite literally.&#160; Yesterday, the sunset was at 4:34pm.&#160; And since it’s so overcast, it was <strong><em>dark</em></strong> by 4:15pm.&#160; We’ve heard that come December, it will be dark by 3:30pm, even though the sun won’t set until 4:20pm.</p>  <p>This is going to be a very depressing winter, we can tell already.&#160; The summer was pretty fabulous overall though.&#160; It got a lot hotter than we wanted it too—especially considering we don’t have A/C.&#160; When it was getting up to 85°-88° in the townhouse during the afternoon, that was pretty rough.&#160; But the sun shined for about 85 days, and it was generally beautiful.&#160; The scenery out here is spectacular.&#160; I definitely recommend visiting out here in August if you can.</p>
