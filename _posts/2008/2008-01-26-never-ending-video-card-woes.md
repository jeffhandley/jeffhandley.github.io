<p>I gave up on the <a href="http://www.visiontek.com/products/cards/pro_series/9250_dms59.html" target="_blank">ATI cards</a>.  I went back to the <a href="http://www.bfgtech.com/3dfuzion/cards_6200LE_pcie_128.asp" target="_blank">GeForce 6200LE</a> PCIe card that I bought for my XP machine.  This gives me dual monitor using the DVI-I and the VGA ports.  Then I bought a <a href="http://www.bfgtech.com/bfgr62256ocp.aspx" target="_blank">GeForce 6200OC</a> PCI card to get to 3 (or 4) screens.</p>  <p>After <a href="http://dyardy.spaces.live.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Dave Yardy</a> gave me the clue about <a href="http://jeffhandley.com/archive/2008/01/12/multi-monitor-support---a-new-clue.aspx" target="_blank">multi-monitor support</a> in Vista, it looked like the PCI/PCI combination would not work.  And PCIe/PCI only works if the 2 cards use the same WDDM driver.  I was hopeful that 2 GeForce 6200 cards would run the same driver and I'd be all set.</p>  <p>Well, the cards run the same driver, but the PCI card just didn't work.  I get lots of random polygons on that screen, lots of ghosting, and it's just plain bad.  This happens whether it's the 2nd card or the only card in the machine.</p>  <p>I talked to BFG tech tonight and the rep thought that I probably just got a bad card.  This seems reasonable considering the card also did not come with the DVI-I to VGA dongle that the box says it comes with.  I wonder if this card was previously returned by someone else, shrink-wrapped again and sold to me.  I submitted an RMA to <a href="http://www.antonline.com" target="_blank">ANTOnline</a> so that I can return the card and try yet another one.</p>  <p>It sickens me that I can't get this to work.  I miss my 3rd monitor!</p>
