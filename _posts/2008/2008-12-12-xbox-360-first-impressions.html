<p>We’ve had our Xbox 360 Arcade hooked up to our new 32” flat panel since last weekend.&#160; So far, my impressions are mixed.</p>  <p>When we first turned it on, we plugged in Pac Man, that came with the console as one of the arcade games.&#160; Wow, it sucked.&#160; There is this moving border thing around the edge of the game board and it’s very distracting.&#160; And the game play seemed quite different from what we were used to.&#160; (Kelly was playing).&#160; Instead of a board full of dots, there were only some dots and it looked like after she ate them, more dots appeared.&#160; Kelly also complained that it was hard to control.&#160; Feeding Frenzy looked pretty fun though.&#160; I played it a little too, and that’s a fun little game with a little bit of marine education mixed in.&#160; That’ll be great for the kids (and us).&#160; The other games were a little blah.&#160; And the free demo games just annoy me—how do I turn that off!?&#160; I don’t want to see these teasers mixed in with the games we own.</p>  <p>As I knew, the Arcade model didn’t come with an HDMI cable.&#160; I don’t know anything about HD, so I figured this just meant I wouldn’t get the HD experience from the Xbox, and I was right.&#160; I had to use the component cable and the TV was getting the signal in 480p (I think).&#160; I decided that I should invest in the cable and I went hunting for one.</p>  <p>Being new to HD and the Xbox and not knowing how it works, I figured that the Xbox needed a special cable.&#160; So my first stop was the Microsoft company store (online).&#160; Nothing.&#160; Next: the Xbox website.&#160; Aha, I found the Xbox 360 HDMI Cable accessory… for $50!!!&#160; Ouch!&#160; Kelly expressed concern about the Xbox and the TV becoming a money pit, so there’s no way at $50 cable would fly.&#160; I ended up sending a note to a distribution list here at work asking if anyone had a spare that they’d sell cheap.&#160; As it turns out, I just needed any basic HDMI cable, and 2 people offered to give me one for free.&#160; Yesterday, I got the cable from one of these fine people and I hooked it up.&#160; Wow, that made a difference!!&#160; It’s very pretty!&#160; It makes the TV look great.</p>  <p>Our main use of this device is expected to be the music and photo capability though.&#160; The Xbox is plugged into the same router as our HP MediaSmart HomeServer.&#160; The HomeServer has like 10,000 digital photos, catalogued by date and time, as well as a few hundred CDs’ music.</p>  <p>I went to the media tab, then to music, and it seemed to find everything perfectly.&#160; Cool.&#160; The interface for playing music is a little odd though, as there are buttons on the screen that have icons that I don’t recognize, and I don’t know what they mean.&#160; And there aren’t any tooltips or anything.&#160; It took a few tries to get it into Shuffle mode.</p>  <p>With the (Christmas) music playing, it’s on to pictures.&#160; For some strange reason, not all of the picture folders are showing up under the home server’s Photos share.&#160; I have a folder for each year, and then subfolders for each month, then folders for each day under that.&#160; At first, 2008 wasn’t showing up at all.&#160; Only half of 2007 was showing up.&#160; When I had time a couple of days later, I decided to investigate.</p>  <p>I thought it might be a permissions thing, and I found that not all of the folders had read access available to 'Network Service', and at first look, it seemed those were the folders not showing up.&#160; So I reset permissions for all child objects of Photos, ensuring that Network Service has Read/List Folder Contents permission.&#160; After this, more folders showed up on the Xbox, but still not all of them.&#160; I could not find any permissions differences between folders showing up and folders missing.&#160; On a whim, I reset permissions for all child objects of Photos again, without changing the effective permissions.&#160; This caused more photos to show up again, but still not all.&#160; Reset permissions yet again, and more photos became available, but again, not all.</p>  <p>Needless to say, this is baffling me.&#160; If I find the (real) solution to this problem, I’ll be sure to post it here.</p>  <p>Something else on the Photos too… when you start a slideshow, it never starts in shuffle mode.&#160; So the first picture is always the same while you work to turn it onto shuffle.&#160; And the UI was a bit odd here too.&#160; The icon shows what you think you want, but the tooltip says, “Turn Shuffle Off.”&#160; It should tell me what the current state is instead of telling me what the action will do; that way the icon matches the description.&#160; This complicated the whole problem of trying to understand these unfamiliar icons.</p>  <p>The last thing we have going on with the Xbox is that I cannot join Xbox Live.&#160; I tried to join but it says that I have to upgrade to the new experience first.&#160; But upgrading to the new experience failed.&#160; After following the troubleshooting steps it provided, I found that my router’s MTU setting is apparently too low.&#160; I’ll have to try to adjust this.&#160; Hopefully the new experience makes the music and photos a little easier to navigate.&#160; And I’ll cross my fingers that it will also correct the problem with discovering the photos, but I’m not optimistic.</p>  <p>I’m excited about the Xbox though.&#160; I think this will be a fun toy for our family.&#160; Kelly does love the music player and having access to our full library of songs.&#160; She told me last night, “It’s like having my own personal juke box.”&#160; She has always longed for a juke box.&#160; I was glad to hear that she is happy with it.</p>  <div class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:c485b61a-436e-4ea3-beb4-6067495a680c" style="padding-right: 0px;
