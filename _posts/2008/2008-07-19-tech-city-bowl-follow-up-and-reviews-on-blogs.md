<p>I wanted to write a follow-up post to say that a manager from Tech City Bowl posted a <a href="http://jeffhandley.com/archive/2008/07/15/rant-bowling-alley-frustration.aspx#198">comment</a> on my blog only a couple of days after I posted my <a href="http://jeffhandley.com/archive/2008/07/15/rant-bowling-alley-frustration.aspx">rant</a> about an experience there.  He has offered a solution to our predicament that I feel is quite satisfactory, and he apologized that we were not better served when we were there the first time.</p>  <p>My son will be able to go to <a href="http://www.techcitybowl.com/">Tech City Bowl</a> to bowl his first game after all.  Hopefully the staff is informed of how to address these types of situations better in the future.</p>  <p>Something I find very interesting about this situation is that only days after posting something to my blog about a poor experience, a manager from Tech City sought me out to resolve the situation.  Since I had heard from two employees that there was no way for my son to bowl there, I didn't seek out management myself, as I didn't expect any satisfactory response; I posted the article on my blog to blow off steam, and I never would have expected Tech City to find the post, contact me, and offer a very nice solution.</p>  <p>This isn't the first time I posted a review on my blog to later be contacted by the vendor.  Garmin sent me a comment in response to my <a href="http://jeffhandley.com/archive/2008/05/01/review-garmin-660.aspx">review of the Nuvi 660</a> we got.  I think it's great that companies actively seek out reviews posted to blogs.  I am a little curious what tooks they are using to find the reviews though.  Perhaps just googling, or maybe the Newsgator feature where you can create RSS feeds that perform web searches.</p>
