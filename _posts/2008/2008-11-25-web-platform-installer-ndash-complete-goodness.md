<p>I decided it was time to install the Beta for ASP.NET MVC and start playing with it when I’m bored.  My gut was to go to <a href="http://www.haacked.com" target="_blank">Phil’s blog</a>, dig around, find the link to the Beta, follow it, download it and futz through the installation process.  But I cringed at how painful that process usually is.</p>  <p>Then I remembered reading about the <a href="http://microsoft.com/web" target="_blank">Web Platform Installer</a> on <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WebPlatformInstallerNowSupportsXPAndTheMasterPlanContinues.aspx" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman’s blog</a> this morning.  I’m typically skeptical of these types of utilities because they usually only half work, and when they fail, it’s really hard to recover.  But I decided to throw caution to the wind and try out this new toy.</p>  <p>After only a few minutes, I got the ASP.NET MVC Beta installed.  Very handy!  Give it a shot.</p>
