<p>Mike and I hung out together the last couple of years in high school, and we had several mutual friends.  Because of Mike, I met my high school sweetheart.  He also taught me about car stereos and introduced me to the idea of saving money--two very important lessons.</p>
<p>While I have not seen Mike since high school, I think of him often.  I am very sad for his family and those that were close to him.  Mike was a great guy.  He is the first of my friends to have passed away.</p>
