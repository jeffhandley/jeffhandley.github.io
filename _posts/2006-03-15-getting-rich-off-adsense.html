I am 7 days shy of having Adsense on my blog for a year.  I never thought I'd be getting rich off Adsense, but I'm humored by the pace of my earnings.<br /><br />Today is one of the better days I've had.  So far $0.49 for the day.  I average $0.04 per day.  I had numerous days over $1.00 while getting some decent traffic due to the heated discussions about the Sirius STV2 car kit.<br /><br />The math is kind of fun though.  Right now, I'm sitting on $10.00 on the nose.  At this pace, I will get my first $100 check 9 years from now.  It feels kind of like having a savings bond in a shoe box under my bed -- one day... just one day... I will be able to use this to buy a nice dinner.
