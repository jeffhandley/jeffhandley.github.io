<p>I started digging through paperwork to try to find my claim number from the accident years ago, and after a few minutes, I found the original claim estimate from the insurance company.&nbsp; I was scanning through it and near the back is a section entitled "Our Promise".&nbsp; It reads:</p> <blockquote> <p>The replacement parts written on the estimate are intended to return the property to its pre-loss condition with proper installation.&nbsp; After repair, if any sheet metal or plastic body part included in this estimate is defective or otherwise fails to meet industry standards for form, fit, finish, durability, functionality or safety, [Insurance Company] will arrange and pay for the replacement of the part, including associated repair costs and rental during these repairs, to the extent not covered by another warranty.&nbsp; This commitment applies as long as you own or lease the vehicle.&nbsp; If you have a problem with a replacement part, call [Insurance Company] at [1-800-Number].</p></blockquote> <p><font color="#666666">Okay, cool, they've got it in writing that they will stand behind the work.&nbsp; Now, I'm guessing the catch will be 1 of 2 things:</font></p> <ol> <li><font color="#666666">Oh, Rust doesn't count</font></li> <li><font color="#666666">or... I see you've had a fender bender recently and your rear bumper is damaged... warranty is void!</font></li></ol> <p><font color="#666666">I have put a call into the insurance company and they immediately pulled up my old claim and listened to the problem.&nbsp; A manager is supposed to call me back before end of business tomorrow.&nbsp; We'll see how it goes.</font></p>
