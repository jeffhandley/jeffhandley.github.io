Well, after seeing a friend's XM radio with the playback features, I'm thinking more about getting satellite radio.<br /><br />I googled for "xm radio versus sirius satellite" and I quickly found the following link: <a href="http://www.radiosatellite.org/">http://www.radiosatellite.org/</a>.<br /><br />Pretty good side-by-side comparison I think.  This seems to push me toward Sirius.  I like the NFL and Stern programming availability on Sirius.<br /><br />Maybe this will be a Christmas gift :-)
