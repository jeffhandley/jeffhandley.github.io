<p>Last Monday, my wife took the boys down to Tennessee in hopes of visiting her aunt Debbie.  Debbie had been ill for quite awhile, after having been diagnosed with <a href="http://www.scleroderma.org/" target="_blank">sclerodema</a>.  Kelly had a ton going on leading up to her trip, including having a playgroup at the house with a dozen other moms and kids, but she felt compelled to go, despite the hectic schedule incurred.</p>  <p>Kelly got to see her aunt Debbie for about 5 minutes on Tuesday.  Wednesday, Debbie had a heart attack and was hospitalized.  Thanksgiving day, the doctors were talking about releasing her, but then she had a series of additional heart attacks, leading to her quick passing.  We got the news of her passing while we were eating Thanksgiving dinner.</p>  <p><code><b>Debbie Petree</b>      <br />Debbie Petree, age 56 of Maryville, went to be face to face with her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on Thursday, November 22, 2007. She was a member of Fairview United Methodist Church. She was preceded in death by her son, Jordan Petree and her father, Newell Manning Standridge. Survivors include her husband, Jack Petree; son, Jacob Petree of Maryville; daughter and son-in-law, Jennifer and Heath Brown of Covington, GA; 2 grandchildren, Garrett and Kenzie Jean; mother, Doris Standridge; brothers and sisters, Dottie Standridge, Newell Standridge Jr., Timmy Standridge, Jan Ingram, Donna Stephens, Denise Jarnigan, Dawn Haynes, several nieces &amp; nephews. The family will receive friends from 2:00 p.m. until 3:00 p.m. Sunday, November 25, 2007 at Fairview United Methodist Church. Memorial Service will follow at 3:00 p.m. with Dr. Jerry Russell officiating. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Scleroderma Foundation, Att: Donations, 300 Rosewood Drive, Suite 105, Danvens, MA 01923, <a href="http://www.scleroderma.org">www.scleroderma.org</a> or any charity of your choice.
