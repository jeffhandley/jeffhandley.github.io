Was hunting for a breakdown of changes from .NET 1.1 to .NET 2.0.  I found this, but it's pretty old:<br /><br /><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/archive/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnnetdep/html/netfxcompat.asp" target="msdn">http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/archive/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnnetdep/html/netfxcompat.asp</a><br /><br /><br />Going to look around a little further... Has anyone else found a good link for this topic?
