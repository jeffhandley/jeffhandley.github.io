So I called Sirius Product Support back today regarding the STV2 optional car kit for the Starmate Replay.  I was very impressed...<br /><br />I opened with, "I spoke with Gary last week regarding the Starmate Replay STV2 optional car kit."  Before I even got that out, Dave said, "uh-huh, yep."  He knew exactly what I was talking about and said the following:<br /><br />- The STV2 optional car kit is expected to hit shelves by the end of this month<br />- They cannot guarantee a date of availability, but they're working to get it out to market as soon as possible<br />- It will most likely show up on <a href="http://www.crutchfield.com" target="crutchfield">Crutchfield.com</a> (<a href="http://www.crutchfield.com/S-bVnnCBTjsqv/cgi-bin/prodsearch.asp?search=stv2" target="crutchfield">check</a>) and <a href="http://shop.sirius.com" target="sirius">shop.sirius.com</a> first<br /><br /><br />I think I'm going to hold off on buying anything (even the receiver) until I can verify that the car kit will work for me.  I know that if I even buy the receiver, I'll want to wire it into the car right away, and I don't want to do that twice!<br /><br />Also, I inquired last week about getting a subscription to Sirius before having the receiver.  I wanted to be able to use the online player during the day before I get my receiver.  I ran through a 3-day trial account, but that expired.  The customer service rep that I talked to advised me to just get another trial account because they can't allow you to get a subscription without a receiver to activate.  So I'm currently on my 3rd trial account.
