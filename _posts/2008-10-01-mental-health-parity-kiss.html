The senate will be voting today on a "sweeter" bailout bill. We were watching CNN this morning while they talked about it, and Kelly and I about flipped out lids. Here's one of the ways the deal is sweeter (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/30/news/economy/bailout_tuesday/index.htm?cnn=yes">from CNN</a>):<br /><blockquote><p>The revised bailout bill also includes a "Mental Health Parity" provision, which would require health insurance companies to cover mental illness at parity with physical illness.</p><p> </p></blockquote>What the fuck? How on earth does this have ANYTHING to do with our economic crisis? Why on earth is this included in this bill? After a cursory search, I found that the senate has been working this issue for several months, so I guess they think they can just lump it in with the bailout to either A) sell the bailout bill; or B) sell the mental health parity bill.<br /><br />I still don't think I want the bailout to pass, but with that said, congress needs to follow the good old KISS principle here: Keep It Simple Stupid! Focus on the bailout, and the bailout only. Deal with mental health parity another time.<br /><br />Also, the "sweeter" bill includes a bump on the FDIC insurance cap from $100K to $250K. While this sounds really nice, I am sure that doesn't come for free. What's the cost? Will interest rates jump dramatically so that the cost of the better insurance can be covered? Will my variable-rate home equity line of credit triple its interest rate? And besides, how does this actually help? It might make things <em>easier</em> for small businesses so that they can deal with fewer banks for their payroll, etc., but it doesn't actually protect <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">anyone's</span> money. And most people don't have to worry about having more than $100K in a bank! Give me a break.
